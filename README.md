# cs2263-project1 (Acquire)

This is a 2 player game of Acquire that is created using Java, JavaFX, and GitFlow.

## Constitution

Team Members: David Lape, Robert Helms, and Fernando Larios.

While we originally had 4 members at first, one dropped the class. We have all been working well together to develop our own version of Acquire. Our main goal is to divide work amongst everyone and to accomplish said work in an effective manner. To optimize work, we will recognize our strengths and weaknesses and pick each other up where we lack. All conflicts will be talked amongst the group and will be decided by majority vote.

## Meetings

* We meet twice a week, Tuesday's at 1 PM in the College of Business meeting rooms and Saturdays at 3 PM and that meeting is usually in person but can be remote on Discord if necessary. In the event of an absence, team members will be notified prior to the meeting and team members will catch that person up as soon as possible.

## Rolls

* Robert Helms - Team Leader/UI Build

* David Lape - Git/Release

* Fernando Larios - Development

## Means of Communication

* Meetings held twice a week (or whenever needed depending on progress of project).

* Discord will be the main use of communication outside of class.
